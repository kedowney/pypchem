    "_Climate connection_  \n",
    "Human activity has changed the composition of the atmosphere in such a way that the temperature of the planet has increased. Polar regions have undergone greater increases in temperature than midlatitudes, a phenomenon called _polar amplification_. Recent research has also shown that this amplified warming has a significant impact on weather at lower latitudes, causing severe episodes of drought and heavy rainfall in North America and Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polar ampification is largely due to a phenomenon called _ice-albedo feedback_. Ice-albedo feedback works as follows: Ice and snow have a high _albedo_, meaning those surfaces efficiently reflect radiation away from the earth's surface. But the water that comes from _melted_ snow and ice has a lower albedo, meaning it absorbs more solar radiation. That, in turn,  warms the surface a little more, which causes more melting, and so on: a postive feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this means that sea ice extent in polar regions is an excellent indicator of climate changes resulting from human activity. To that end, climate scientists have taken careful measurements of the seasonal melting and freezing of ice in polar regions, as well as trends in that melting and freezing from year to year. Here, you will examine some of these datasets. "

    "_Sea ice volume and extent_  \n",
    "Sea ice _volume_ is the total volume of sea ice at any given time, usually for a given region; we have Arctic sea ice volume and Antarctic sea ice volume. At both poles, the sea ice volume varies a lot over a season. Some data are given in Figure 1. During the Arctic winter, because the sun is down 24 hours a day, ice volume steadily builds up. The maximum occurs in April, at which point the sun finally rises high enough in the sky that ice begins to melt. Melting continues until September, when cold once again sets in, and ice volume begins to increase.\n",

    "One question for climate scientists concerns _how_ Arctic ice melts seasonally. Is more volume lost at the edges, or through thinning of the entire ice cover? It turns out that if you know sea ice volume _and_ extent, then you can also estimate the _thickness_ of the ice. This follows from simple dimensional analysis: volume has dimension $distance^3$, while extent has dimension $distance^2$. So the ratio between them tells you about the thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this CGI, you'll look at some Arctic sea ice data and try to come up with an answer to this question. In doing so, you'll develop familiarity with the seasonal and year-to-year patterns of sea ice growth and melt, as well as skill at visualizing and analyzing the available data. "
