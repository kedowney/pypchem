    "We have argued that human activity has changed the pattern of sea ice melt in the Arctic through the qualitative idea of ice-albedo feedback. Confidence in making predictions about the future requires quantitative treatment as well. In this CGI, you will explore this idea in two ways. First, you will estimate how _much_ energy is required to effect the seasonal melt of Arctic ice from April to September. Secondly, you will construct a phase diagram of water based on fundamental thermodynamic properties of water.  "

For the ending point of the integrals, we'll use the notation $P_{liq/vap}^*$. The integrated result is called the _Clausius-Clapeyron Equation_ for liquid-vapor equilibrium.
